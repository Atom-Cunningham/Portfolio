Three projects from my software engineering course
written in java
One individual project, a cryptogram solver,
which uses a gui to prompt a user to solve a
cipher.
One partner project, connect 4,
which uses threading and a P2P server process
And one group project, a tower defense game.

Unfortunately all 3 of these projects use
observer/observable and javafx, which are
no longer supported. The code is still there,
but its difficult to recompile these.
