To run:
launch Mars4.5la
open the copy of asm4.s in the testSep subdirectory
assemble
run

asm4.s is an assembly language program which
takes a string and a map (char:char), 
and encrypts the string, and outputs it


Program specifications: view asm4.html

Notes: asm4.s assembles correctly iff there is only
one testcase in the same directory as asm4.s
